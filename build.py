    Splits dataset into train / test / validation using a predefined set of camerea-label allocations.

    This method puts all tracks into 'camera-label' bins and then assigns certian bins to the validation set.
    In this case the 'test' set is simply a subsample of the validation set. (as there are not enough unique cameras
    at this point for 3 sets).

    The advantages of this method are

    1/ The datasets are fixed, even as more footage comes through
    2/ Learning an animal on one camera / enviroment and predicting it on another is a very good indicator that that
        algorthim has generalised
    3/ Some adjustment can be made to make sure that the cameras used in the test / validation sets contain 'resonable'
        footage. (i.e. footage that is close to what we want to classify.

    The disadvantages are that it requires seeing animals on multiple cameras, which we don't always have data for.
    It can also be a bit wasteful as we sometimes dedicate a substantial portion of the data to some animal types.

    A posiable solution would be to note when (or if) the model over-fits then run on the entire dataset.

    Another option would be k-fold validation.
