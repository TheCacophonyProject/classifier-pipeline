# hands moving fast, this triggers the moving background toggle and so is here to test images with moving backgrounds.

# background generates 2 phantom videos (moving clouds maybe?)
# solution might be updating the background?
# there are actually 2 birds in this clip... make sure to check times
# also would be nice to add options like origin

# 1 track, make sure you don't track the moving clouds / sky up the top.
# 20171125-163931-akaroa09.cptv

# similar to 20171125-163931-akaroa09 but harder.
# 20171127-050458-akaroa09.cptv

# This video contains 3 birds, but they are hard to make out.
# 20171103-180015-akaroa04.cptv

# this is a really good example where there should be just 1 track.
# unfortnately the current tracking algorithm looses sight of it.
